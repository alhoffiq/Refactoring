# Refactoring

## My work

I first added an appropriate title to the page. I then changed all the <div> elements into <section> and <aside> elements where appropriate. All of the <img> tags lacked and alt element so I added one for each and removed a closing img tag for the last image since <img> tags do not need a closing tag to go along with them. I also added the viewport meta tag in the <head> just for good practice
